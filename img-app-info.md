# Human Scream Detection Model

This model accepts a directory of audio file inputs (specifically .wav files). On runtime the model outputs a CSV file (in the output directory selected) classifying all the audios in the input directory into two classes, **'Scream Detected'** and **'Scream Not Detected'**. The CSV file will also contain the exact file path of the audio files for better accessibilty!
